# Yale Course Scheduler

## Overview
In this problem set, you'll create a simple course scheduling application for Yale students. The app will allow users to view a list of courses, add courses to their schedule, and remove courses from their schedule.

## Requirements
1. Display a list of available courses (at least 5 courses).
2. Each course should have a name, code, and credit hours.
3. Allow users to add courses to their schedule.
4. Display the selected courses in the schedule.
5. Allow users to remove courses from their schedule.
6. Show the total credit hours of selected courses.
7. Implement basic styling using CSS.

## Bonus Challenges
- Add a search functionality to filter courses.
- Implement a maximum credit hour limit (e.g., 18 hours) and prevent adding courses that exceed this limit.
- Add a visual indicator (e.g., color change) for courses that conflict in time slots.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository and open it up in VSCode or any code editor of your choice.
2. From the root directory of the project, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Open `src/App.jsx` and `src/App.css` and begin implementing the PSET!

Good luck, and happy coding!
